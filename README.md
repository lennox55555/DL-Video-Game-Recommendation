# ðŸŽ® GameQuest: A Deep Learning Powered Game Recommendation System
  ![Background](https://media.giphy.com/media/l378BzHA5FwWFXVSg/giphy.gif) 

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the DL-Stock-Picker project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- AWS account with appropriate permissions for S3
- AWS CLI installed on your machine

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lennox55555/DL-Video-Game-Recommendation.git
cd DL-Video-Game-Recommendation
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up AWS credentials**

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following content:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
AWS_REGION=your_preferred_region
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual AWS credentials.

4. **Run setup.py**

```bash
python setup.py
```

This will:
- Configure AWS with your credentials
- Download the necessary data files from S3 to your local data directory

You can ignore the "error: no commands supplied" message at the end of the setup script. This is a standard message from setuptools and doesn't affect the setup process.

You should see `all_video_games.csv` or other project data files.

## Problem Addressed 

Most video game recommendation systems are integrated within proprietary platforms like the PlayStation Store or Steam. These systems often exhibit inherent biases, as companies tend to promote specific games. Additionally, the recommendations are typically limited to games available on their respective platforms (e.g., Steam focuses exclusively on PC games within its ecosystem or  titles they have rights to) and are tailored solely to their user base. In contrast, our approach stands out because it leverages data from Metacritic, a widely trusted platform where gamers and critics independently share ratings and reviews for a diverse range of games across different platforms and consoles. This dataset spans video games dating back to 1995, many of which are unlikely to be featured on modern proprietary platforms like the PlayStation Store. While we explored datasets related to Steam users in Australia and Steam-specific games, we opted for a platform-agnostic approach that relies on authentic reviews from critics and gamers across various platforms and consoles, ensuring broader coverage and reduced bias. While our goal is to offer a more comprehensive and unbiased approach to recommending video games, we acknowledge that it is impossible to fully account for potential biases in the critics' and gamers' reviews.

## Data Sources
**Video Game Dataset**
- Source: [Video Game Dataset](<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/beridzeg45/video-games/data>)
- Author: Beridze Giorgi
- Description: "The dataset contains all the video games that have been featured on Metacritic.com from 1995 to January 2024. It includes over 14,000 unique video game titles across all platforms and genres"
- Usability: The dataset is structured in a tabular format, with a usabilty score of 10.0 
- License: There is no specified license here. The only thing mentioned is "Other (specified in description)", but the description does not contain details about the dataset's license
- Sourcing: "The data was collected using Python's Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries" by scraping Metacritic.com website 
- Details: The dataset contains information about video games such as  Title, Release Date,Developer,Publisher, Genres, Product Rating,User Score,User Ratings Count etc..

This dataset is used in our project to supply items information.

**Metacritic PC Games Reviews**
- Source: [Video Game Users & Critics Dataset](<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/beridzeg45/metacritic-pc-games-reviews/data>)
- Author: Beridze Giorgi
- Description: "This dataset is a collection of 512 thousand reviews for 5449 different games gathered from Metacritic.com"
- Usability: The dataset is structured in a tabular format, with a usabilty score of 10.0 
- License: There is no specified license here. The only thing mentioned is "Other (specified in description)", but the description does not contain details about the dataset's license
- Sourcing: "The data was collected using Python's Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries" by scraping Metacritic.com website 
- Details: The dataset contains information about video games' reviews such as Game Title,Game Poster,Game Release Date,Game Developer,Genre,Platforms,Product Rating,Overall Metascore,Overall User Rating,Reviewer Name,Reviewer Type,Rating Given By The Reviewer,Review Date,Review Text
- Note: Since the dataset contains reviews from both critics and players, we are making the assumptions that both types of reviewers have played or interacted with the game long enough to be able to submit their review.

This dataset is used in our project to supply users information such as the user's rating of the different games (we are using the Rating Given By The Reviewer and normalizing it between 0 and 10 as the rating and the Reviewer Name as the user_id). 

## Review of Relevant Previous Efforts on this Dataset
When it comes to previous efforts done on the datasets, only a few notebooks have been pushed to the Kaggle dataset repo. All of these notebooks are performing EDA on the datasets, but none of them have gone to the extent of creating models to recommend items. One of the notebooks implements an ML model, but that is used to predict game features rather than recommending games.

## Modeling Approach 

### Naive 
This system reads the CSV of video games ratings and calculates the average rating for each game. When the user picks a game they like on the web app, the model suggests other high-scoring games while mixing in a bit of randomness to add variety and extra details like a short description. It also checks how good its suggestions are by comparing its predicted scores to real ratings using a simple error metric (RMSE).

## Ethics Statement

Our project seeks to address biases in proprietary video game recommendation systems by leveraging data from Metacritic, a trusted platform for independent reviews from gamers and critics. While our approach is platform-agnostic and aims to provide broader coverage, we acknowledge that the data may still contain subjective biases inherent in user and critic reviews.

The datasets used, Video Game Dataset and Metacritic PC Games Reviews, were sourced from Kaggle and collected via web scraping. Since their licensing terms are unclear, we have taken care to use them responsibly and encourage others to verify usage rights before applying them commercially.

We are committed to transparency, ethical data usage, and improving bias mitigation strategies in future iterations of this project. By documenting our methods and assumptions, we aim to build trust while contributing to unbiased video game recommendations.
